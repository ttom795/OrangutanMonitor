# Orangutan Monitor

A neat little bit of software I wrote to monitor the size of my page-file. It's a useful accompaniment to Yuzu or any other page-file hungry programs. Standalone .exe file, no .dlls or anything else required.

Uploaded as a Visual Studio 2019 project but can probably be compiled on anything (though note - it does contain Windows API calls).
