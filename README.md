# Orangutan Monitor

A neat little bit of software I wrote to monitor the size of my page-file. It's a useful accompaniment to Yuzu or any other page-file hungry programs. Standalone .exe file, no .dlls or anything else required.

Uploaded as a Visual Studio 2019 project but can probably be compiled on anything (though note - it does contain Windows API calls).

The program shows the maximium page-file size and currently used page file size in MB. Also has a bar indicating the percentage, which is also visible. Detail and non-detail mode just toggles the exact decimal percentages for each value displayed.
